<b>Additional Report</b>
<br/> The additional report is the number of appointments by Type and Second Division Level. The purpose of this report is to see concentration of type of appointment by location, so that we can see what areas attract what types of appointments, and where we should perhaps align headcount.
<br/>
<br/> As an example, if the organization sees that we have a high concentration of Customer Intake appointments in the UK, we should align Sales Headcount resources to that location.
